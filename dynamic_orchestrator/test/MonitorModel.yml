# The availability of resources of the federation is represented with a 
#      list of Edge Miniclouds / Cloud ( without name, which is not important), 
#      each of which is constituted by a dictionary of couple
#      { resource name, quantity available }  
# Every link between Edge Miniclouds/Clouds is directed, and is reported in 
#      an adjacency list after every component, indicated with the special key 'links'
# Every number in the dictionary 'links' represents the position 
#      of the Edge Miniclouds/Clouds with which it communicates; it is a dictionary 
#      of available resources/ actual value of QoS indicator monitored and 
#      attached to the communication link
