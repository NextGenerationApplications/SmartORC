# Every resource is indicated in descending order respect to the 
#      respective resource availability in the MonitorModel file
# No equality constraints by now
# The application is represented with a list of components ( name 
#      of components are not important ), each of which is constituted
#      by a dictionary of couple { resource name, minimum quantity requested }  
# Every link is directed, and is reported in an adjacency list 
#      after every component, indicated with the special key 'links'
# Every number in the dictionary 'links' represents the position 
#      of the component with which it communicates; it is a dictionary 
#      of resources attached to the communication link and required by
#      the component on that link as an QoS indicator
